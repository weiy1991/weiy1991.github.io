My research primarily encompasses perception, decision-making, planning, and control in autonomous driving. All of my research efforts are implemented in real-world applications, as I firmly believe that true research value can only be realized through practical deployment.

Applications
======

* Self-driving logistic vehicles: 
  * My team has developed full-stack software and algorithms for unmanned logistics vehicles, and has implemented the use of more than 300 unmanned logistics vehicles in multiple factories, including SAIC-GM-Wuling and CATL's Sichuan factory.

* Perception-based unmanned forklift:
  * Traditional unmanned forklifts rely heavily on high-precision positioning to operate. My team has developed a perception-based unmanned forklift based on non-repetitive scanning technology. This technology, combined with natural positioning accuracy of approximately 5cm, allows for an operational accuracy of 2cm. This system is being used for outdoor forklift unloading at SAIC-GM-Wuling.

* Finished vehicle transfer vehicle: 
  * Traditionally, finished cars need to be manually transported after they roll off the assembly line, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Our team has developed a transport vehicle that can achieve both indoor and outdoor navigation and is used in SAIC-GM-Wuling's island-style factory.

* Unmanned logistics full chain: 
  * Based on unmanned forklifts, unmanned logistics vehicles and AGVs, the whole chain of logistics work from unmanned forklift unloading, unmanned logistics vehicle transfer, to AGV online operation is realized, and it is applied to the engine manufacturing line of SAIC General Materials
