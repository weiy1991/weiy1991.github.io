Welcome! Iâ€™m a Associate Professor School of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence, East China Normal University.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on multi-modality and real-world deployable embodied intelligence. I am particularly interested in integrating tactile manipulation, deformable simulation, and perception to develop robust solutions for robot manipulation tasks. My work aims to advance the field of soft robotics and enable intelligent systems to operate effectively in complex, real-world environments.
